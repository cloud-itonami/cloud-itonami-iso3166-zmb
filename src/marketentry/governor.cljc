  "Market-Entry Compliance Governor -- the independent compliance layer
  that earns the MarketEntry-LLM the right to commit. The LLM has no
  notion of Zambian procurement law, whether a claimed engagement fee
  actually equals base + months x rate, whether the engagement's own
  declared bidder-origin/contract-type/estimated-value actually
  triggers the ZPPA Regulation 20(1) citizen-subcontracting mandate, or
  when a draft stops being a draft and becomes a real-world
  eprocure.zppa.org.zm submission, so this MUST be a separate system
  able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is `:market-entry-compliance-governor`
  (shared family keyword on blueprints).

  This blueprint's own text (docs/business-model.md Trust Controls:
  'any actual portal registration or filing submission requires
  Market-Entry Compliance Governor clearance and always escalates to
  human sign-off'; 'a false or fabricated regulatory-requirement claim
  is a HARD hold') names exactly the checks below.

  Five checks, in priority order, ALL HARD violations: a human
  approver CANNOT override them. The confidence/actuation gate is
  SOFT: it asks a human to look (low confidence / actuation), and the
  human may approve -- but see `marketentry.phase`: for `:stake
  :actuation/draft-filing`/`:actuation/submit-filing` NO phase ever
  allows auto-commit either. Two independent layers agree that
  actuation is always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis                  -- did the jurisdiction proposal cite
                                       an OFFICIAL source
                                       (`marketentry.facts`), or invent
                                       one?
    2. Evidence incomplete         -- for `:filing/draft`/
                                       `:filing/submit`, has the
                                       jurisdiction actually been
                                       assessed with a full evidence
                                       checklist on file?
    3. Subcontracting mismatch     -- for `:filing/submit`, when the
                                       engagement declares
                                       `:seeking-subcontracting-
                                       determination? true`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the engagement's own claimed
                                       citizen-subcontracting compliance
                                       matches ZPPA's own published
                                       Public Procurement Regulations,
                                       2022 Regulation 20(1) / Second
                                       Schedule mandate for its own
                                       declared procurement, and
                                       HARD-hold if not. FLAGSHIP
                                       genuinely new check for this
                                       vertical -- a THRESHOLD-GATED
                                       MINIMUM-PERCENTAGE SET-ASIDE
                                       mandate (foreign bidders only)
                                       whose shape differs from every
                                       prior sibling's own flagship
                                       check (see `marketentry.registry`
                                       docstring for the full
                                       comparison).
    4. Engagement fee mismatch     -- for `:filing/submit`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the engagement's own `:claimed-
                                       fee` equals `base-fee +
                                       monthly-rate x monitoring-
                                       months` -- honest reapplication
                                       of the ground-truth-recompute
                                       discipline sibling actors use.
    5. Confidence floor / actuation
       gate                          -- LLM confidence below threshold,
                                       OR the op is `:filing/draft`/
                                       `:filing/submit` (REAL acts)
                                       -> escalate.

  off dedicated `:drafted?`/`:submitted?` facts (never a `:status`
